## Azure_Services
Web3Chronicles utilizes several Azure services to ensure seamless deployment, security, and performance:

- Azure App Service: Web app hosting service for building, deploying, and scaling web apps. It supports various programming languages and frameworks, including Node.js for our MERN stack application.

- Azure Key Vault: Securely store and manage sensitive information such as API keys, secrets, and certificates. Key Vault integrates with Azure services and allows you to control access to keys and secrets.

- Azure Monitor Services: Monitor the performance and availability of your application. Azure Monitor provides comprehensive solutions for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry from your cloud and on-premises environments.

For security reasons, some variables have been hidden from view and used as environmental variables with the help of dotenv package. Below are the variables that you need to set in order to run the application:

- MONGO_URL: this is the connection string of your MongoDB Atlas database.

- SECRET: you can provide any string here, it is used to encrypt the JWT authentication token.
- PORT: you can provide the port number here.
